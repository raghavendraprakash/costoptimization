# Challenge: Software Licensing Cost Optimization

## Problem Statement

TechNova Inc., a rapidly growing financial technology company with 2,500 employees across 12 global offices, is facing significant challenges with their software licensing expenses. The company's annual software licensing costs have increased by 37% year-over-year, now representing approximately $4.2 million annually, or 15% of their total IT budget.

An internal audit revealed several critical issues:

1. **License Overprovisioning**: The company has purchased enterprise-level licenses for creative software suites for 750 employees, but usage analytics show only 320 employees use these applications regularly.

2. **Abandoned Licenses**: Nearly 200 licenses belong to employees who have left the company in the past 18 months, but these licenses remain active and billed.

3. **Version Fragmentation**: Multiple versions of the same software are being maintained across departments, resulting in unnecessary duplicate licensing costs.

4. **Lack of License Reclamation Process**: No formal process exists to reclaim and reassign licenses when employees change roles or leave the company.

5. **Decentralized Procurement**: Individual departments can purchase software independently, leading to redundant applications with overlapping functionality.

6. **Suboptimal License Types**: Many users with occasional software needs have been assigned perpetual licenses instead of more cost-effective consumption-based options.

7. **Missing Volume Discounts**: Software purchases are made ad-hoc throughout the year rather than consolidated to leverage volume discounts.

The CFO has mandated a 25% reduction in software licensing costs within the next fiscal year without compromising employee productivity or introducing security risks. The IT department must develop a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges while supporting the company's continued growth.
